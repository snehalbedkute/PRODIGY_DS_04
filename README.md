**Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 4:**

Welcome to my submission for Task 4 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. I have analyzed and visualized sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

**Dataset :** Here I used this dataset twitter_training.csv
This dataset contains tweets with labeled sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) tied to specific entities (like people, products, or organizations

**Tools and Libraries used :**
Python 
Pandas 
Matplotlib 
TextBlob 

In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset with over 74,000 entries. After cleaning the data by removing null values and duplicates, I analyzed the distribution of sentiments—Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Irrelevant—across all tweets. I then focused specifically on tweets mentioning "Microsoft" to explore brand-specific sentiment trends. Visualizations were created using bar and pie charts to clearly represent the results. This analysis offers insights into public perception of brands on social media. Tools used include pandas for data handling and matplotlib for visualizations.
